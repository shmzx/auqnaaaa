        <br><li> How can I be trained in CPR? </li>
        <br>
        The letters CPR stand for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The term embraces all the procedures 
        from basic first aid to the most advanced medical interventions that can be used to restore the 
        breathing and circulation in someone whose heart and breathing have stopped.
        For lay people and first aiders, CPR refers to the basic first aid procedures that can be used to keep 
        someone alive until the emergency medical services can get to the scene. The most important skills are chest 
        compressions to pump blood around the body, and rescue breaths to provide oxygen. Rescue breaths are 
        also known as ‘mouth to mouth’.
        <br><br>
        <li>Is there a type of CPR I can learn?</li>
        <br>There are two types of CPR exist and both have a potentially life-saving impact.<br><br>
  1.   Hands-only CPR. Involves calling for help and then pushing on the chest in a rapid motion in example, chest compressions. 
  Hands-only CPR can prevent a delay in getting blood moving through the body.<br><br>
  2.   Traditional CPR with breaths. Also called CPR with breaths, this alternates chest 
  compressions with mouth-to-mouth breaths. This type of CPR can give the body more oxygen in the critical moments before help arrives.

  <li>Why is it crucial to learn water safety?</li><br>
  In such way accidental drownings can be prevented by knowing how to swim, practicing water safety rules, and having supervision.
  <br><li>What steps should be taken immediately after an injury occurs?</li>
  <br>After an injury occurs, it's important to follow these steps: <br>
  1. Ensure safety: Remove the injured person from any immediate danger.<br>
  2. Assess the situation: Determine the severity of the injury and whether professional medical help is required.<br>
  3. Provide first aid: Administer basic first aid techniques, such as controlling bleeding, immobilizing fractures, applying ice packs, or providing pain relief.<br>
  4. Seek medical attention: If the injury is severe, or if there are concerns about the extent of the injury, seek medical help promptly.<br>
