        <li>CPR - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique that's useful in many emergencies in which someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped.</li>

        <b>Step 1 -</b> Place the person carefully on their back and kneel beside their chest. Tilt their head back slightly by lifting their chin. Open their mouth and check for any obstruction, such as food or vomit. Remove any obstruction if it is loose. If it is not loose, trying to grasp it may push it farther into the airway.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Step 2 -</b> Place your ear next the personâ€™s mouth and listen for no more than 10 seconds. If you do not hear breathing, or you only hear occasional gasps, begin CPR. If someone is unconscious but still breathing, do not perform CPR. Instead, if they do not seem to have a spinal injury, place them in the recovery position. Keep monitoring their breathing and perform CPR if they stop breathing.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Step 3 -</b> Place one of your hands on top of the other and clasp them together. With the heel of the hands and straight elbows, push hard and fast in the center of the chest, slightly below the nipples. Push at least 2 inches deep. Compress their chest at a rate of at least 100 times per minute. Let the chest rise fully between compressions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Step 4 -</b> Making sure their mouth is clear, tilt their head back slightly and lift their chin. Pinch their nose shut, place your mouth fully over theirs, and blow to make their chest rise. If their chest does not rise with the first breath, tilt their head. If their chest still does not rise with a second breath, the person might be choking 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Step 5 -</b> Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing or help arrives. If an AED arrives, carry on performing CPR until the machine is set up and ready to use.
    </p></ul>
        <h1 style ="text-align: left; margin: 5px 50px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: azure;">When to use CPR and when not to?</h1> 
    <ul style="font-family: arial; font-size: large; color:#ffffff; background-color: #ff5e00; opacity: 0.8; border-radius: 30px; margin: 5px 50px; padding: 30px 70px">
        Use CPR when an adult is not breathing at all. For a child or infant, use CPR when they are not breathing normally. Always use CPR if the adult or child is not responding when you talk to them or tap them. 
        If someone is not breathing, giving CPR can ensure that oxygen-rich blood reaches the brain. This is important, as without oxygen, someone can sustain permanent brain damage or die in under 8 minutes. <br><br>
        <b>A person might need CPR if they stop breathing in any of the following circumstances:</b>
        <li>cardiac arrest or heart attack</li>
        <li>choking</li>
        <li>a road traffic accident</li>
        <li>near-drowning</li>
        <li>poisoning</li>
        <li>a drug or alcohol overdose</li>
        <li>smoke inhalation</li>
        <li>electrocution</li>
        <li> suspected sudden infant death syndrome</li>
        <br>
        Only perform CPR if the adult is not breathing, or in children and infants, when they are not breathing normally, and their blood is not circulating. This is why it is important to ensure that the person does not 
        respond to verbal or physical calls to attention before starting the CPR process.

            Learning water safety is just one way you can make your family and your community safer. Learning is easy and gives you skills you can carry with you wherever you go. It's one of the many ways you can prepare yourself, your family and your community for emergencies 
            When we come together, we become part of something bigger than us all.
        <br><br>
        <li><b>Panic</b> is a sudden unreasoning and overwhelming fear that destroys a person's capacity for self-help.</b>
        It is motivated by the fear of drowning and may be precipitated by such conditions as exhaustion, cramps, currents, and injuries from marine life.</li>   
        <li><b>Exhaustion</b> is simply loss of energy and the resultant inability to make necessary movements to keep afloat and make progress through the water.</li>
        <li><b>Cramps</b> is a spasmodic contraction of the muscles usually caused by fatigue, cold, or overexertion.</li>

        <li>Assess the situation and remember your training
            <br>
            a) Be calm<br>
            b) Pinpoint the subject's position<br>
            c) Make sure medical aid has been summoned appears needed if it<br>
            d) Keep curious bystanders from interfering with the rescue effort<br></li><br>
        <li>Planning the rescue quickly and calmly (Prescribed Pattern of Rescue). A competent lifesaver follows a prescribed pattern, planning his rescue and must consider his options before any action is taken. The pattern to follow is called the order of methods of rescue. It starts with the easiest and most common and progresses to the more difficult situation.
